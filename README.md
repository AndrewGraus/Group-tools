# Group-tools
Tools for James Bullock's group and friends

The purpose of this github is to organize all of the useful code that is floating around our group in one place

From our initial brainstorming session here are some of the things we think belong in here:

1) Pointers to codes (like MUSIC, spheric, ect.)

2) Particle moving scritps (like converting binary to hdf5, or moving particles around within the file)

3) Visualization tools

4) Scripts for making plots look nicer

5) Submission scripts for various supercomputers (greenplanet, stampede, discover, ...)

6) Make files, config files, and parameter files for running gizmo on various machines

7) Analysis tools, such as things for calculating density profiles, or calculating velocity dispersions

8) anything else you can think of
