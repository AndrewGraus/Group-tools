These scripts are for taking gadget binaries created by MUSIC and distributing their
particles

for example split_gb_5to4 takes 5 dark matter particle masses (five zoom levels) and distributes
them among 4 particle types, with two (the two most massive) in the final group (boundry group
or Particle Type 5)

split_gb_6to4 takes 6 dm particle masses and divides them among the same 4 groups but now 2 are
in the bulge group and 2 are in the boundary group
